now.sh
======

A simple shell script that prints current date/time while waiting 
for an input and echoing it to the stdout.

It is particularly useful with [`tail`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_%28Unix%29) 
when following log files. Instead of - 

    tail -F access.log | grep "GET / "

yielding -

    173.199.116.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:05:18 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2249 ...
    59.167.170.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:10:19 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2307 ...
    54.251.76.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:16:52 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2223 ...

use -

    tail -F access.log | grep "GET / " | now

and get -

    173.199.116.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:05:18 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2249 ...
    59.167.170.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:10:19 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2307 ...
    54.251.76.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:16:52 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2223 ...
    Mar  3 01:20:59 PST 2013

where **the last line is reprinted every second** with current time.

This gives 
an idea of when the last log activity was without needing to remember what 
the server time zone is or what the "-0800" translates to in your local time.

Timestamp format
================

The timestamp format can be adjusted by passing the 
[`date`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_%28Unix%29) 
format string to `now`. For example, this tweak -

    tail -F access.log | grep "GET / " | now "[%d/%b/%Y %H:%M:%S %z]"

yields -

    173.199.116.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:05:18 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2249 ...
    59.167.170.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:10:19 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2307 ...
    54.251.76.xx - - [03/Mar/2013 01:16:52 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2223 ...
    [03/Mar/2013 01:20:59 -0800]
